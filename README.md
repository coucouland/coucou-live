# Coucou Social

Publish and share notes, events and updates with other users.

## Overview

Whilst most social media platforms try to lock in user-generated content, Coucou is based on an open
data model, using standard to promote interoperability and sharing of data.

Where most site focus on the user expererience as the top priority, Cocuou recognises that how content
is stored and accessed is just as important for longevity and utility of user data.

## Collections

User content is stored in collections, which are used to group common objects concerned with a particular
theme or content type. For example, a stamp collector may create a collection of post-war stamps to share.

Collections may be shared with everyone (public), with a limited group of users (protected), or not shared 
at all (private). Publically shared collections will appear in a directory of discoverable content.

## Subscriptions

Users may subscribe to public or protected collections (via approval) in order to receive new and updated
content.
